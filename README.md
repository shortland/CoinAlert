Rest In Peace.

When my friend told me to buy BTC in highschool, it was worth $120 - $200.

When I first became seriously interested in BTC in University, it was worth $2k.

When I started this project BTC was worth $6k.

It is now $17k. Is it too late?

One of many stories (*shrugs*)

...

The guy at the store I was at yesterday told me some guy on 4chan told him to buy 100 BTCs for $1 back when it first started.

I guess we all have regrets (*shrugs*)
